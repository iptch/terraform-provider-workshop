# Custom Plan Modifiers

Computed attributes are attributes of your resource schema that are not set by
the user but are set by your code. They are used to store values that are
calculated from other attributes or from the state of the resource.

You can use a computed attribute to store the hash of the schema file. This
will allow Terraform to detect changes to the file and force a replacement. 

```go
"schema_hash": schema.StringAttribute{
  Computed:            true,
  MarkdownDescription: "Example configurable attribute",
  PlanModifiers: []planmodifier.String{
    stringplanmodifier.RequiresReplace(),
  },
},
```

However the hash of the file is not changed until the `Create` method is called
this happens after Terraform has run the plan. To handle this you can use a
custom plan modifier to check the hash of the file and force a replacement.

## Handling changes to schema files

When you change your Terraform resource for example should you change the
schema file from `car.zip` to `truck.zip` Terraform will detect this change
and force a replacement of the resource. As the schema has a `PlanModifier`
`stringplanmodifier.RequiresReplace()` that forces a replacement.

This is needed because the API does not allow you to mutate a schema, 
you can only create and delete them. Howwever there is an additional complexity
what if the file changes but the name does not? Terraform will not detect any 
changes and will not force a replacement. We can work round this by adding a 
computed attribute to the resource that stores a hash of the file.


However, in order for terraform to understand that the hash has changed it
needs to run some custom code at plan time. This is done using a custom `PlanModifier`.

Let's look at how you can implement a custom plan modifier.

### Calculating the hash of the file

To handle changes to the underlying schema file, you need to store a hash of
the file in the Terraform state. The following code block is a pretty standard
Go way to calculate a hash from a file. Add this to the bottom of your `schema_resource.go`
file.

```go
func calculateHashFromFile(path string) (string, error) {
  // generate a hash of the file so that we can track changes
  f, err := os.Open(path)
  if err != nil {
    return "", fmt.Errorf("Unable to generate hash for schema file: %s", err)
  }
  defer f.Close()

  h := sha256.New()
  if _, err := io.Copy(h, f); err != nil {
    return "", fmt.Errorf("Unable to generate hash for schema file: %s", err)
  }

  return base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(h.Sum(nil)), nil
}
```

## Custom Plan Modifier

Let's now add the check as a plan modifier which is a block of code that 
executes when Terraform runs a plan. At this point you can check the existing 
stored hash with a new computed value from the schema file in the new plan.

To create a plan modifier, you need to create a type that implements the 
`StringPlanModifier` interface. This interface requires you to implement
three methods. One from the String interface and two from the `Describer`
interface.

```go
type String interface {
  Describer

  // PlanModifyString should perform the modification.
  PlanModifyString(context.Context, StringRequest, *StringResponse)
}

// Describer is the common documentation interface for extensible schema
// plan modifier functionality.
type Describer interface {
  // Description should describe the plan modifier in plain text formatting.
  // This information is used by provider logging and provider tooling such
  // as documentation generation.
  //
  // The description should:
  //  - Begin with a lowercase or other character suitable for the middle of
  //    a sentence.
  //  - End without punctuation.
  Description(context.Context) string

  // MarkdownDescription should describe the plan modifier in Markdown
  // formatting. This information is used by provider logging and provider
  // tooling such as documentation generation.
  //
  // The description should:
  //  - Begin with a lowercase or other character suitable for the middle of
  //    a sentence.
  //  - End without punctuation.
  MarkdownDescription(context.Context) string
}

```

Our plan modifier to check the hash looks like the following.

```go
type schemaPlanModifier struct{}

func (s *schemaPlanModifier) Description(ctx context.Context) string {
  return "checks if the file represented by schema has changed"
}

func (s *schemaPlanModifier) MarkdownDescription(ctx context.Context) string {
  return s.Description(ctx)
}

func (s *schemaPlanModifier) PlanModifyString(ctx context.Context, req planmodifier.StringRequest, resp planmodifier.StringResponse) {
  // generate a hash from the file
  attrPath := path.Empty().AtName("schema")
  schema := ""
  req.Plan.GetAttribute(ctx, attrPath, &schema)

  attrPath = path.Empty().AtName("schema_hash")
  schemaHash := ""
  req.Plan.GetAttribute(ctx, attrPath, &schemaHash)

  // if empty probably first apply
  if schemaHash == "" {
    return
  }

  // caclculate and compare the hash
  newHash, _ := calculateHashFromFile(schema)
  if newHash != schemaHash {
    // set the new value and set the requires replace, Terraform will force the resource to be re-created
    resp.PlanValue = types.StringValue(newHash)
    resp.RequiresReplace = true
    resp.Diagnostics.AddWarning(
      "Schema File Changed",
      fmt.Sprintf("The file %s has changed from when the resource was originally created, this forces the destruction of the resource. Old file hash: %s, New file hash: %s", schema, schemaHash, newHash),
    )
  }
}
```

Breaking this down, the following code allows you to get an attribute 
value from the Terraform plan and set it to a Go type.

```go
attrPath := path.Empty().AtName("schema")
schema := ""
req.Plan.GetAttribute(ctx, attrPath, &schema)
```

Then you check if the hash has been set; if you do not do this check, then 
you will return an incorrect error the first time a plan runs since there will
not be an existing hash to compare.

```go
if schemaHash == "" {
  return
}
```

Finally, compare the hash and return a warning if things have changed. There is
no need to return an error as it is legitimate that the schema file
could change. However, since the API does not accept mutations of schema,
Terraform needs to destroy the resource and re-create it.

```go
newHash, _ := calculateHashFromFile(schema)
if newHash != schemaHash {
  // set the new value and set the requires replace, Terraform will force the resource to be re-created
  resp.AttributePlan = types.StringValue(newHash)
  resp.RequiresReplace = true
  resp.Diagnostics.AddWarning(
    "Schema File Changed",
    fmt.Sprintf("The file %s has changed from when the resource was originally created, this forces the destruction of the resource. Old file hash: %s, New file hash: %s", schema, schemaHash, newHash),
  )
}
```

Add the `schemaPlanModifier` in the previous code block to the bottom of your 
`schema_resouce.go` file.

You can then update the `schema_hash` attribute to add this modifier to the
exising collection of `PlanModifier`.

```go
"schema_hash": schema.StringAttribute{
  MarkdownDescription: "Example configurable attribute",
  Computed:            true,
  PlanModifiers: []planmodifier.String{
    &schemaPlanModifier{},
    stringplanmodifier.RequiresReplace(),
  },
},
```

**Note**
There is already an existing plan modifier `stringplanmodifier.RequiresReplace()`, this 
tells Terraform to replace the entire resource should the value of this attribute
change from an existing value in the state.

Finally, let's update the `Create` method to set the hash of the file to the
`data` model that will be persisted to the state.

```go
hash, err := calculateHashFromFile(data.Schema.ValueString())
data.SchemaHash = types.StringValue(hash)
```

This completes the `Create` method before you move on to the `Read`, method
let's check that your code compiles. Before you do, there is one small change
that needs to be made in the `provider.go` file.

## Defining Provider Resources

All resources you create for your provider must be registered so that Terraform
understands which resources the provider has.

This is done in the `Resources` method for the provider that is defined in
the file `provider.go`. The method returns a collection of available resources
it is important to remember that when you create a new resource type, you add it 
to this collection.

Update the Resources method in the provider so that it looks like the following.

```go
func (p *ScaffoldingProvider) Resources(ctx context.Context) []func() resource.Resource {
  return []func() resource.Resource{
    NewSchemaResource,
  }
}
```

You can then check your code compiles by running `make build` in the terminal.

```shell
make build
```

```shell
go build -o bin/terraform-provider-example_v0.1.0
```

Assuming all went well, you should have no errors, and you can now move on
to implementing the `Read` method for the `schema` resource.
