title: Provider Overview
---

If you are using the browser based editor, open the folder
`/home/src/provider`. If you are using your own editor you need
to open the folder `./provider, for the rest of this guide we will refer
to all filepaths as if you are using the browser based editor.

The `provider` folder has been cloned from the HashiCorp scaffolding example that can
be found at:

[https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework)

There are a number of sub folders in this this folder, these are:

| Folder       | Description                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| docs | Autogenerated documentation |
| examples | Example Terraform configuration for the provider |
| tools | Scaffolding folder to import the documentation generation tools |
| internal/provider | Source code for the provider |

There are also some important files

| File         | Description                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| GUNmakefile  | Makefile for the provider containing commands for building |
| terraform-registry-manifest.json | Manifest file needed by the Terraform registry |

## Testing the Build

Before continuing, let's validate that your environment is working correctly
and that you can build the example.

Open your terminal at the location where the provider source is and run the
following command to build the provider.

```shell
make build 
```

```shell
go build -o bin/terraform-provider-minecraft_v0.1.0 -buildvcs=false
```

If you look at the bin folder, you will see the following file.

```shell
âžœ ls -las ./bin 
total 18792
    4 drwxr-xr-x 2 nicj nicj     4096 Nov 13 11:57 .
    4 drwxr-xr-x 9 nicj nicj     4096 Nov 13 07:13 ..
18784 -rwxr-xr-x 1 nicj nicj 19232757 Nov 13 11:57 terraform-provider-minecraft_v0.1.0
```

## Plugin Install Location

This file can not be run directly, instead it is designed to be loaded by Terraform.
Terraform requires that the file has a specific format:

```shell
terraform-provider-[name]_v[semver]
```

This file then needs to be installed into `$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins` again with
a specific naming convention.

```shell
~/.terraform.d/plugins/local/[organization]/[name]/[version)/[architecture]/
```

#### Organization
The organiztion is your organization name, this generally aligns to the org
of your GitHub account.

#### Name
This is the name of the provider, when creating a repository for a provider
you need to ensure that the following convention is used for the registry
to import it `terraform-provider-[name]`. This follows the same convention
that the binary name uses.

#### Version
The semantic version of your provider without any `v`.

#### Architecture
This is actually the operating system and the architecture that the provider
has been built for. It corresponds to the GOOS and GOARCH settings.

[https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment](https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment)

The makefile `GNUmakefile` contains some example configurations for building
your provider for the most common operating systems and architectures.

Let's now start to build our provider.
